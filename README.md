 # Getting Started

 This project dublicates a simple submission form which can be further implemented in the server in future if necessary to store user data. 

 ## The Components

 It consists of only two main components, that are the submission form and the data confirmation page. You simply enter your information on the form which appears as soon as you launch the website. 
 The data can be viewed after submission and is also temporarlily cached in the memory which means it can is not just read only, but if necessary can be stored from server side using more functionality.
